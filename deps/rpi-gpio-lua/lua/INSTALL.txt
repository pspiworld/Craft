This package is based on the RPi.GPIO Python Module created by Ben Croston.

Get the sources here: https://code.google.com/p/raspberry-gpio-python/downloads/

Unpack the tarball in the parent directory of RPi.GPIO.Lua so that you get the
following directory structure:

RPi.GPIO-0.5.3a  RPi.GPIO.Lua

./RPi.GPIO-0.5.3a
./RPi.GPIO-0.5.3a/RPi
./RPi.GPIO-0.5.3a/source
./RPi.GPIO-0.5.3a/test

./RPi.GPIO.Lua

Now install the Lua Development package.

On Raspbian:
sudo apt-get install liblua5.1-0-dev


To compile the Lua module, cd to RPi.GPIO.Lua and run make.

A GPIO.so file will be created, which can be used in your Lua scripts.
